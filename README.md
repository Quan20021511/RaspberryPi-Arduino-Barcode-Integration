# Barcode Scanner and Arduino Control

[Project Video](https://github.com/Quan20021511/Sel-Navigating-Robot/assets/129273695/71b8e4b7-ed2f-4c86-875b-bddf6c52ca3b)

A versatile system that combines barcode scanning and control of servos and DC motors using a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino. This project is suitable for various applications, including inventory management, automation, or robotics.

## Key Features

- Barcode detection and decoding using OpenCV and pyzbar on a Raspberry Pi.
- Control of two servos and DC motors with precise angles and movement.
- Two predefined barcode values (`barcode1` and `barcode2`) trigger specific actions on the Arduino.
- Communication between the Raspberry Pi and Arduino via serial connection.
- Code provided for both the Raspberry Pi and Arduino, making it easy to replicate and modify the system.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Raspberry Pi with a compatible camera module.
- An Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno).
- Python (for Raspberry Pi) and the required libraries (OpenCV and pyzbar).
- Arduino IDE for uploading the sketch to the Arduino.
- Necessary hardware components for motor control (e.g., servo motors, DC motors).

## Getting Started

- Upload the provided Arduino sketch to your Arduino board.
- Set up your Raspberry Pi with the camera module.
- Make the necessary hardware connections.
- Clone this repository to your Raspberry Pi.
